We will much appreciate contribution. Just create a new [pull request](https://github.com/hnes/libaco/pulls)

## Todo

New ideas are welcome! Please create a new [issue.](https://github.com/hnes/libaco/issues/new)

* Add a macro like `aco_mem_new` which is the combination of something like `p = malloc(sz); assertalloc_ptr(p)`.

* Add a new API `aco_reset` to support the reusability of the coroutine objects.

* Support other platforms (especially arm & arm64).
